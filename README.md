Search Tab: searching chrome tabs in a simple way
------

### Status: prototype

I have implemented a prototype, you can fork to make it a real tool.

### Plan

There's alreay a tool called TooManyTabs does good job, but I need something simpler and pretty.
So I decided to write my own one, which looks like:

* Sublime's GotoAnything (partly done)
* Opera tab switching UI (looks not bad now..)
* give more options

### Usage

`git clone` this repo and load the code in develop mode of Chrome.  
You are most likely to see how it works at this moment.
