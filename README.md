Search Tab: searching chrome tabs in a simple way
------

### Status: prototype

I have implemented a prototype, you can fork to make it a real tool.

Feature I have now:

* call is with "ctrl backquote" ``ctrl ` ``
* instant search
* search titles and urls
* use keys to navigate, (up down enter esc)
* stick to your initial tab

Bugs you may found:

* on some browser default pages.. it doesn't work
* it doesn't search bookmarks and history, and some pages are strange
* it's not cool enough

### Plan

There's alreay a tool called TooManyTabs does good job, but I need something simpler and pretty.
So I decided to write my own one, which looks like:

* Sublime's GotoAnything (partly done)
* Opera tab switching UI (looks not bad now..)
* give more options

### Usage

`git clone` this repo and load the code in develop mode of Chrome.  
You are most likely to see how it works at this moment.
